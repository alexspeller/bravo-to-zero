#Â Bravo to Zero

Inbox Zero is great in theory, but it's easy to let it slip and suddenly there are hundreds of emails in your inbox and it takes forever to archive them.

Bravo to Zero makes it easy to get back to zero, by showing you groups of emails that you can archive in bulk. Try it now with your real Google Mail account, or with dummy data.
